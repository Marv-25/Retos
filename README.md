Hi, I'm Marvin. I'm from El Salvador. This repo is part of my education and training, I like python, so I've been learning and solving hackerrank's challenges,
2 first weeks out of 4.(https://www.hackerrank.com/interview/preparation-kits/one-month-preparation-kit/one-month-week-one/challenges) I also know about OOP and HTML, CSS, a little JS, since at the beginning I was trying to learn web dev.
I learned thanks to platzi, freecodecamp, w3schools, INSAFORP, and many other great platforms, although I'm still far from expert. 
But now I'd rather focus on ML and AI, I studied marketing so I know about statistics. And I like data analysis since I've done some financial analysis.
Although I don't really know about frameworks, I know about Django, just the basics, and SQL as well. 
I'll keep on learning as I've been doing ever since the pandemic started.
My telegram is @Marv_10 in case you'd like to contact me :)
