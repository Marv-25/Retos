This repo is part of my education and training, I like python, so I've learning and solving hackeerrank's challenges.
I also know about OOP and HTML, CSS, a little JS, since at the beginning I was trying to learn web dev.
But now I'd rather focus on ML and AI, I studied marketing so I know about statistics. And I like data analysis since I've done some financial analysis
